After resetting my laptop recently, I was faced with the gruelling task of reconfiguring my laptop with all the software needed. Rather than repeating this task every time a new machine is setup, today I show how #Docker containers can be used with #Bash to set up #MySQL and #phpMyAdmin on your local machine in less than 5 minutes without the need of going through the arduos installation of all their dependencies locally. In the future, more containers can be added to the #dockercompose script, making it easy to set up and share coding environments with others.

Data ingestion can be a messy process involving many tools and decisions. 



Today I demonstrate how #python  can be used to consolidate the entire data ingestion process running on portable #dockercontainer s: starting from designing and creating #sql tables based on entity relationship diagrams to performing #etl on the data into the database using #batchprocessing. 



Finally, a total of 41 million Bixi bicycle rides data were ingested and accessed through SQL queries in Python for simple data visualizations. Next time,  further EDA will be performed on the data to identify insights and possibly create a dashboard for operations performance tracking.
