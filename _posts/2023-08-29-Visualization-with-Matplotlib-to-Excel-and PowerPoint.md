![013_001.png](assets/images/013_001.png){:class="img-responsive"}

[Previously](https://andrewyewcy.com/Data-Ingestion-with-SQLAlchemy-+-Python/), a data ingestion pipeline was set up to decompress ZIP files and ingest Bixi rides data into a MySQL database. In this article, we explore how SQL was used within Python to summarize "large" data (35 million rows) for highly customizable plotting with Matplotlib. Then, to automate reporting, the plot was exported into both PowerPoint and Excel using Python. The figures and deliverables were designed with the context of presenting the number of annual Bixi rides to management and finance.

# Overview of Setup

## Docker Environments

The docker containers and Python requirements can be setup by forking the Github repository and running the below line in Terminal in a computer with Docker installed:


```python
docker-compose -f dev_setup.yaml up
```

Docker will handle, build, and connect all containers required to replicate this notebook.

## Import Packages and Define Functions

To create Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint (PPT) files directly in Python, the [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [python-pptx](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) packages were used.


```python
# For general data processing
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import math
import time
from PIL import Image

# Custom functions for measuring time of queries and to print lists
from notebook_functions.timer import timer_wrapper
from notebook_functions.print import print_list

# For static plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import Patch
import seaborn as sns

# For the engine that connects Python and MySQL
import sqlalchemy

# For creating PowerPoint files  using python-pptx
from pptx import Presentation
from pptx.util import Inches
from pptx.enum.text import PP_ALIGN

# For creating Excel files using openpyxl

As the year 2022 contains data in a different format compared to previous years (membership data is removed), the year 2022 was excluded from analysis for demonstrative purposes. First, a COUNT statement was used to count how many rides were to be analyzed.


```python
# SQL Statement to count the number of rides aggregated by the start date of each ride in UTC timezone.
sql_stmt = """
SELECT
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    rides
WHERE
    YEAR(start_dt_utc) < 2022
"""

df = pandas_read_sql(engine,sql_stmt)
```

    Run 1 of pandas_read_sql took 16.4294 seconds.
    Total run time: 16.4294 seconds. Average run time: 16.4294 seconds. 
    



```python
df.head()
```

    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {

The simplest of queries took 19 seconds to run. A total of 35 million Bixi rides were to be analyzed. Now, a more complex query was written to summarize the 35 million rides into a smaller table that does not overload the computers memory. For deeper exploration beyond just annual rides, the query was written to summarize Bixi rides by day and membership. 


```python
# SQL Statement to count the number of rides aggregated by the start date of each ride in UTC timezone.
sql_stmt = """
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(CONVERT_TZ(start_dt_utc,"+00:00","-04:00"), "%Y-%m-%d") AS yyyymmdd,
    is_member,
    COUNT(*) AS rides
FROM
    rides
WHERE
    YEAR(start_dt_utc) < 2022
GROUP BY
    yyyymmdd,
    is_member
"""

df = pandas_read_sql(engine,sql_stmt)
```

    Run 2 of pandas_read_sql took 231.2026 seconds.

The results returned from the SQL query had 3,447 rows and 3 columns. This makes sense as To avoid running the SQL query every time, the output was saved as a CSV file for later use. The SQL query took 320 seconds to run, which is quite long for such a simple query due to the size of the data. The query time may be improved using cluster computing methods such as Apache Spark, accessed through , which will be explored in future notebooks.

To avoid rerunning the query, the dataframe was saved as a CSV for future access if needed.


```python
# Save query output to avoid rerunning query
df.to_csv("../12_processed_data/20230825_rides_daily.csv", index = False)
```

## Assumptions

All Bixi rides were included regardless of length of trip. This can be adjusted in the future as trips that are too short might overestimate the number of meaningful rides per year.

# Data Visualization - Rides by Year

## Plot Data Preparation - Pandas Resampling

The `resample` method in `pandas` is powerful for performing aggregations on time-series, for example aggregating daily rides to monthly rides by resampling. To use `resample`, the DataFrame needs to have a datetime index. For this plot, both member and non-member rides were included.


```python
# Include both member and non-member
plot_df = df.groupby(
    by = ['yyyymmdd'],
    as_index = False).agg(
        rides = ('rides','sum')
)    
    
# Convert yyyymmdd column to datetime
plot_df["yyyymmdd"] = plot_df["yyyymmdd"].astype("datetime64[ns]")

# Use yyyymmdd as index
plot_df.set_index(["yyyymmdd"], inplace = True)

# Examine the dataframe
plot_df.head()
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>rides</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>yyyymmdd</th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>2014-04-15</th>
      <td>1577</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2014-04-16</th>
      <td>3180</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2014-04-17</th>
      <td>5852</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2014-04-18</th>
      <td>5325</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2014-04-19</th>
      <td>6031</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



The index was observed to be changed to `yyyymmdd`. Now, the `resample` method can be used to calculate the number of Bixi rides by year. Notice that the index has been summarized to the 1st month and 1st day of every year. 
How `resample` aggregates can be changed by referring to the different [Offset aliases](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).


```python
# Resample from day to year
plot_df = plot_df.resample("1YS").sum()
plot_df.head()
```

<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {

    }

        text-align: right;
    }

      <th>yyyymmdd</th>
      <th></th>

    <tr>
      <th>2014-01-01</th>
      <td>3136276</td>
    </tr>

      <td>5277541</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



For ease of plotting, a new column was created to extract just the year from each date in the index. Furthermore, as the rides are in the millions, the `rides` column was divided by 1 million to improve plot readability. Finally, the year and year percentage change in annual ridership were calculated using the `pct_change` method.


```python
# Divide rides by 1 million for readability
plot_df["rides"] = plot_df['rides']/1_000_000

# Extract year from datetime index
plot_df["year"] = plot_df.index.year

# Calculate year on year change percentage
plot_df["YoY_pct"] = plot_df["rides"].pct_change(1)
```


```python
# Examine the dataframe
plot_df.head(10)
```

</div>



The year on year change in ridership (YoY_pct) can be verified through below calculation:


```python
# (2015 rides - 2014 rides) / 2014 rides
print(f"The year on year percentage change for 2015 compared to 2014 was {np.round((3.443883 - 3.136276) / 3.136276 * 100,2)} % increase.")
```

    The year on year percentage change for 2015 compared to 2014 was 9.81 % increase.


The years 2020 and 2021 were observed to have significant `YoY_pct` changes compared to the other years, most likely due to Covid-19 lockdowns. As these two years are uncommon cases, they will not be included in the plot to avoid skewing the plot.


```python
# Create a new YoY_pct column where 2020 and 2021 are masked with null values
plot_df["YoY_pct_plot"] = np.where(plot_df["year"] <= 2019, plot_df["YoY_pct"], np.NaN)

## Simple Bar Plot

To get a gist of the data, the `plot` method built into Pandas was used to quickly generate a plot of Bixi rides by year.


```python
# Initiate figure object
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
    nrows = 1,
    ncols = 1,
    figsize = (10,5)
)

# Use the convenient matplotlib plot method in pandas
plot_df.plot(
    x = "year",
    y = "rides",
    ax = ax,
    legend = None,
    color = "cornflowerblue",
    kind = "bar"
)

# Remove spines for neatness
sns.despine()

saved_img = f"../22_assets/images/basic_plot.png"
fig.savefig(
    fname = saved_img, 
    dpi = 300,
    format = "png",
    bbox_inches = "tight")

# Show plot
plt.show()
```

![013_002.png](assets/images/013_002.png){:class="img-responsive"}

In this simple bar plot, it was observed that the number of rides per year was steadily increasing from 2014 to 2019, until Covid-19 in 2020. Furthermore, ridership recovered to pre-pandemic levels by 2021. 

However, the plot is not presentation ready:
- axis and plot titles missing
- xlabels hard to read vertically
- exact ridership not immediately clear to reader (have to guess by drawing lines to axis with eyes)
- Covid-19 situation was not highlighted as anomaly
- year on year change percentage not quantifiably apparent (not clear how much increase)

## Customized Figure with Matplotlib and Seaborn

To fix all the above issues, the below large chunk of code was used to generate a very customized barchart, showcasing the power of matplotlib and Python over spreadsheet tools like Excel. The ups and downs of using Matplotlib and Python over traditional spreadsheet tools like Excel are summarized in the table below:

|  | Python + Matplotlib | Spreadsheets |
|---|---|---|
| Visualization <br>Customization | 👑 |  |
| Data Processing | 👑 |  |
| Automation | 👑 |  |
| Technical <br>Difficulty |  | 👑 |
| Initial Set Up |  | 👑 |

Finally, rather than explain the all the code in a text blob, comments were included for each section of code to better guide the reader along the process of creating the custom visualization.


```python
def plot_annual_ridership(plot_df):
    
    # Initiate a figure object with 3 subplots in on top of each other
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(
        nrows = 3,
        ncols = 1,
        figsize = (7,7),
        height_ratios = [20,1,5], # The middle serves to generate a broken axis
        sharex = True # Share the same x-axis to ensure bars are aligned by year

Now the above function can be used to generate the plot and and to add annotations.

mid_x1 = ((high_x1-low_x1)-2)/2 # Leaving a white space in the middle for text annotation
mid_x2 = high_x1 - mid_x1

# Add vertical lines at x_start and x_end
ax_1[0].plot([low_x1, low_x2],[low_y1,low_y2],'k-', lw=1)
ax_1[0].plot([high_x1, high_x2],[high_y1,high_y2],'k-', lw=1)

# Add horizontal lines from x_start and x_end to the middle

ax_1[0].plot([high_x2,mid_x2],[high_y2,high_y2],"k-",lw=1)

# Calculate average annual change for given years

    xy = ((high_x1-low_x1)/2,high_y2),

# Export to Microsoft PowerPoint

A simple but clear PowerPoint was created using the code block below. Although aged, the [python-pptx](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package can be used to automate the creation of detailed PowerPoints.


```python
# Create presentation object
prs = Presentation()

# Create a title slide
title_slide_layout = prs.slide_layouts[0]
slide = prs.slides.add_slide(title_slide_layout)
title = slide.shapes.title
subtitle = slide.placeholders[1]
title.text = "Bixi Rides Analysis 2014 - 2021"
subtitle.text = "by Andrew Yew [2023-08-29]"

# Create a image slide
blank_slide_layout = prs.slide_layouts[6]
slide = prs.slides.add_slide(blank_slide_layout)
img_path = saved_img
img = px_to_inches(img_path)

# Calculate side spaces to center image in slide
left = Inches(prs.slide_width/914400 - img[0]) / 2
top = Inches(prs.slide_height/914400 - img[1]) / 2

# Add image to slides
pic = slide.shapes.add_picture(img_path, left, top)

# Save presentation
prs.save(f"../22_assets/presentations/{time.strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M')}_{title.text}.pptx")
```

# Export to Microsoft Excel

The Excel file is supplementary material for the finance team, who might want to have the numbers in a convenient Excel workbook for them to follow along the PowerPoint. The [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package was used to format the pandas dataframe into a neat presentable table within an Excel workbook.


```python
# Create an Excel workbook
wb = Workbook()

# Create a named worksheet
ws = wb.create_sheet(title = "bixi_annual_rides", index = 0)

# Create a list for column names
plot_df_xlsx = plot_df.rename(
    columns = {
        "year" : "Year",
        "rides" : "Rides ('M)",
        "YoY_pct" : "YoY % Change"
    }
)

columns_to_print = ["Year", "Rides ('M)", "YoY % Change"]

for index, column in enumerate(columns_to_print):
    col_alpha = get_column_letter(index + 1)
    ws.column_dimensions[col_alpha].width = 15
    cell = col_alpha + f"10"
    ws[cell] = column
    ws[cell].font = Font(bold = True)
    line = Side(border_style = "thick")
    ws[cell].border = Border(bottom = line)

    for row_index, value in enumerate(plot_df_xlsx[column].to_list()):
        cell = get_column_letter(index + 1) + f"{row_index + 11}"
        ws[cell] = value

        if index == 0:
            line = Side(border_style = "thin")
            ws[cell].border = Border(right = line)

        if column == "YoY % Change":
            ws[cell].number_format = "0.00%"
        elif column == "Rides ('M)":
            ws[cell].number_format = "0.00"

img = pyxl_Image(saved_img)
img.height = 700
img.width = 700

ws.add_image(img,f"A{11 + plot_df.shape[0]+3}")

wb.save(f"../22_assets/spreadsheets/{time.strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M')}_{title.text}.xlsx")
```

# Conclusion

35 million Bixi rides were summarized using SQL before plotting with Matplotlib. Then, the plots were exported into both Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint files for reporting. In the future, the long query time will be reduced using PySpark with the data stored in Parquet file format instead of comma separated values(CSV).
